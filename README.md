# Data-Exploration
This is the second in the series of projects. Here, our purpose is to do a pre-analysis examination of the ‘Credit Card Application’ (CAD) data set which we cleaned up in a prior project.  In the previous project, we successfully removed all the missing values in the data set. Now, as a prelude to data analysis we ask questions in order to investigate and better understand the data set. In order words, we seek to find answers to why the phenomenon described in the data set happened. We are looking for opportunities to expand the scope of our search for a plausible model of the classifier variable.  Probably, a diagnostic analytics of the data set might reveal unintended discoveries along the way.
